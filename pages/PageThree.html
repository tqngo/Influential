                <p>Having somoene to look up to is always a blessing. Knowing that I have my older sister,</p>
                <p>Trang as a role model gives me hope that I can be a great person in life. Being the </p>
                <p>third child out of four and having an older brother, you would think that I would look up
                </p>
                <p>to him, but this isn't the case. Trang is the second eldest and I can't ask for a better role </p>
                <p>model to set an example for what life puts in front of me.</p>

                <br>
               <p>Trang influences me in a way that I could see her as my second mother. My parents</p>
                <p>immigrated from Vietnam with little to no knowledge of the English language. Which
                <p>put Trang on a higher pedistal. She had to fill the shoes of my mom due to the huge</p> 
                <p>language barrier my mom had with America.</p>

        <p>Trang learned best by those who influenced her the most, her parents. As a child of immigrants, she saw first
            hand
        <p> the hard effort it takes to provide for others, and she in turn, also wanted to give back to others by
            volunteering</p>
        <p> and fundraising efforts. She worked hard to build her career. She started off by volunteering in a substance
            abuse</p>
        <p> clinic, which led to being hired full-time, to being given the opportunity to grow an study to become a
            substance</p>
        <p> abuse counselor. She worked in a behavioral/metal health setting for 11 years and it taught her how to be
        </p>
        <p> compassionate and understanding to the different kinds of trauma people can endure.</p>
        <br>
        <p>During the pandemic, as with many others, the excess time shifted her focus to explore other career fields.
        <p> As a challenge to herself, she decided to pivot and work in education which so far she's been doing great
            at.</p>
